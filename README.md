# CS303-Assignment1

To run the program, open the "Assignment1CS303.sln" file with Visual Studio, and press f5 from the IDE menu.

This assignment uses an expanding array by using pointers. Users are able to add, remove, and change values of the array.
The program also allows reading from an input file to fill the array. Place a .txt file of numbers into the same directory as the other files.
